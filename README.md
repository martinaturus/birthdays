## Implementation of a Birthday reminder


In this repository you can find a file named ```birthday.py``` that contains a small list of birthdays of famous people and a function ```return_birthday()``` that returns the birthday of a person. This function is used in the ```main.py``` file to test if "Albert Einstein" and "Alan Turing" are in the list. If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you the following result:

```
$ python main.py
Albert Einstein's birthday is 03/14/1879.
Sadly, we don't have Alan Turing's birthday.
```
